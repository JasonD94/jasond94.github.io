          <h3 class="text-white">Overnight visits</h3>
          <p class="text-faded">Overnight Visits provide your pets with extra attention and your home with added security in your absence. These visits are between 10-12 hours in length and are typically scheduled during the hours of 8pm through 8am. During an Overnight Visit, your pets will enjoy all the benefits of two Extended Visits (one in the evening and another in the morning). We provide our own bed and linens and welcome your furry kids to cuddle up with us.</p>

          <p class="text-faded">The perfect solution for dog owners who work long days or wish to go out after work without having to stop home. We can also schedule additional Dog Walks on days when longer visits are provided. These are 20 minute visits, most of which is spent walking your dog(s) around the neighborhood… with a few minutes set aside for love and cuddles.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">We first hired Wagmore Quality Petcare when our dog, Abby, was on medication that required extra time outside while we were at work. Four years later, Bob and his team are still walking Abby. Her extra daily walk was so beneficial, we never stopped them once she was off the medicine. She enjoys her extra walk and the love and attention she gets. Bob has even spent days with her when we have day trips and don’t want her to be alone too long. I am confident that Abby is in good hands with Wagmore.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">Because my husband and I both work full time, we needed a solution to care for our precious fur baby during the day while we are at work. Wagmore Quality Petcare has been a complete lifesaver for our family. Since our dog (Bonzo) was 8 weeks old he’s been under the care of Bob Zwaan and his team, two 30 minute walks a day. Bob was instrumental in helping us train Bonzo and always provides exceptional service to his clients. His love for animals and his willingness to go to great lengths to accommodate his clients has been so apparent to my husband and I over the last 3 years. Bob and his team are reliable, extremely trustworthy, and they are in this business because they genuinely want to make your pet’s day a happier, better one. We also utilize Bob’s overnight boarding services when we need care for Bonzo when we are traveling. Bob sends us pictures and updates to let us know how Bonzo is doing, and we are able to enjoy our trip knowing he is receiving the best of care.</p>
