    91.461 Assignment: Creating Your First Web Page

    Created: September 3rd, 2015.
    Last Updated: September 5th, at 4PM.

    Note: much of this design comes from a previous personal website that I built over the summer.
    I've redesigned this one, using much of the same <head> but redoing nearly all of the body.
    Some of the CSS is similar or reused, but most of it was changed.
    I also added multiple pages and the navigation bar at the top. The navigation bar has a dropdown menu titled "Index"
    that will contain links to future projects and assignments.

Bootstrap is also being used for its grid system and for the Nav bar. -->

<!-- This is the Nav Bar, for switching between pages. It should automatically become smaller on Mobile.
(Test this though!)

Note: I originally wrote part of this for another web page, and I reworked it for this web page (notedly adding
the dropdown menu for linking to additional assignments).
